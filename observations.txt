parsing_text_files.cpp:17:35: error: no matching function for call to ‘getline(std::ifstream&, std::string&, const char [2])’
   17 |         getline(in_file, line, ":");
      |                                   ^

Solution: Use ':' char as getline delimiter

error: no match for ‘operator<’ (operand types are ‘const Person’ and ‘const Person’)
  386 |       { return __x < __y; }
      |                ~~~~^~~~~

Solution: Define operator overloading function

warning: ISO C++ says that these are ambiguous, even though the worst conversion for the first is better than the worst conversion for the second:
   11 |     c3 = c1+c2; //assignment operator

In file included from main.cpp:1:
Complex.h:26:9: note: candidate 1: ‘Complex operator+(const Complex&, const Complex&)’
   26 | Complex operator+(const Complex &c1, const Complex &c2);
      |         ^~~~~~~~
Complex.h:20:14: note: candidate 2: ‘Complex& Complex::operator+(const Complex&) const’
   20 |     Complex &operator+(const Complex &other) const;
      |              ^~~~~~~~

Solution: Remove either function or method implementation of assignment operator
